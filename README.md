# TheBigOne

**Summary**
I partially completed a mini robotic arm, that when completed, will be able to draw with a marker or paint brush. I faced a few challenges, such as conflicting I2C addresses, learning how to use shields and their custom libraries, and having my windows computer give me a BSOD, which ultimately cause me to be unable to complete my project.
