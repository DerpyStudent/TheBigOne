**Summary**
>I want to build a device that is essentially a scaled down automotive paint booth. Using spray paint cans, I want a device that I can use to quickly and effectively give my 3d printed objects a fresh coat of paint. I am not quite sure on the design yet. I was also thinking about how there are already a homemade 3d scanner designs on the internet, and how instead of copying that, I could take it a step further. I don't know how feasible this is, but it would be interesting to create a device that scans an object, generates a 3d map of it, and then uses the map to make sure every surface is coated with paint?
Possibly using a laser or ir or something to determine what surfaces have already been painted? Could even be motion based? I am not really sure on the technological limits. Input would be from cameras/sensors, and output would be to motors for rotation of either the spray paint or the object being coated as well as output to something that is activating the spray paint.

**Component Parts**
>Camera, motors, laser?, sensors of some type. I can 3d print or handcraft any structures needed for this project. I'll have to order the electronic components unless I can get them for free from somewhere.

**Challenges**
>I think one of the hardest parts will  be nailing down a design that I like tha can be accomplished in 5 weeks

**Timeline**
>I hope to get a design down in the next week, then I can figure out the electronics I need, and order them. By the second week I would like to know how evverthing needs to be connected, and start on 3d models for printing. I will probably want to set aside a week for fabrication, just in case of any technical errors.
